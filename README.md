About this project:-

# Computer Vision Multimodel Project  

This project demonstrates advanced real-time computer vision functionalities, integrating:  
- **Hand Gesture Detection**: Recognizes hand gestures to perform specific actions like controlling system volume.  
- **Object Detection**: Identifies objects in real-time using the YOLO model.  
- **Drawing Application**: Allows users to draw on the screen using hand gestures, enabling a creative and interactive experience.  

## Key Features  
- Real-time gesture recognition for interactive control and drawing.  
- Object detection using state-of-the-art YOLO algorithms.  
- Volume control functionality that adjusts system volume through gestures.  
- Drawing functionality for freehand sketching using intuitive hand movements.  
- Intuitive GUI with an attractive background, detailed descriptions for buttons, and a project title: *"COMPUTER VISION MULTIMODEL PROJECT."*  

## Technologies Used  
- **Mediapipe** for gesture recognition.  
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for object detection.  
- Python with GUI enhancements for user-friendly interaction.  

This project explores the integration of computer vision techniques with interactive user interfaces, making technology more accessible, creative, and intuitive.
